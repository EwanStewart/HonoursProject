The head of a linked list is the first node and the tail is the last node.,true
To create a linked list in C++ we start with a pointer to the tail of the list.,false
If the linked list is empty a new node added to the end of the list becomes both the head and tail.,true
To traverse a linked list we start at the tail and follow the pointers to the previous nodes.,false
