Big O Notation shows how an algorithm scales based on input size, true
Big O Notation is used to classify algorithms efficency according to how their requirements grow as the input size grows, true
Linear complexity O(n) means that an algorithm will take the same amount of time as the input increases, false
Algorithms have the exact same runtime across different machines, false
Space complexity means the amount of space the algorithm needs to run, true
Big O complexity cannot be visualized with graphs, false
