Linked lists are a data structure used in programming to store and organize data. They are made up of nodes, where each node contains a data element and a reference to the next node in the list.
The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node is called the tail. Linked lists are useful for many reasons. For example, they can be used to implement dynamic data structures that can grow or shrink as needed. They can also be used to implement queues, stacks, and other abstract data types.
A node is a data structure that contains a data element and a reference to the next node in the list. In a singly linked list, each node has only one reference, which is to the next node. In a doubly linked list, each node has two references, one to the previous node and one to the next node.
/A node in a linked list is a struct that contains a data element and a pointer to the next node in the list. In C++, we can define a node like this:
/Here, data is the data element stored in the node, and next is a pointer to the next node in the list. We use a pointer instead of a reference because we will be modifying the node pointers in memory.
/To create a linked list, we start with a pointer to the head of the list, which is initially null. We add nodes to the list by allocating memory for a new node, setting its data element, and updating the pointers.
The head and tail attributes are pointers to the first and last nodes in the list, respectively. The add_node method creates a new node with the given data and adds it to the end of the list. If the list is empty, the new node becomes both the head and tail. Otherwise, the new node is added to the end of the list and becomes the new tail.
Adding a node to the end of a linked list can be done in O(1) time complexity.
/To traverse a linked list, we start at the head and follow the pointers to the next nodes until we reach the end of the list. Traversal can be done in O(n) time complexity. Here's an example of how to print the data elements in a linked list, the method starts at the head of the list and prints each data element in turn. It stops when it reaches the end of the list, which is indicated by a null pointer.
/To remove a node from a linked list, we need to update the pointers of the nodes before and after the node to be removed. Removing a node from the list can also be done in O(1) time complexity if we know the node's position. Here's an example of how to remove a node with a given data element:
