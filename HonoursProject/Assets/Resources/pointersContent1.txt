Pointers are a distinctive feature of C and C++, they provide a powerful feature but also can be dangerous.
A pointer is a reference type â€“ it points to another variable in memory. Which provides lots of useful utility.
These are pointers:  int *p, char *q;
These are not pointers: int n, char c;
/Here is an example of a pointer pointing to a memory location.
Pointer p now points towards integer n, you can now dereference the pointer to use the value it is pointing to.
Using the * symbol when interacting with pointers will reference a literal value. Whilst using the & symbol will reference the memory address.
These symbols can be used interchangably to meet the needs of the program.
/Outputting *p, will now print the value of n so in this case p will have the value of 42.
